phaser-template
===============

A simple template project for a game using [Phaser](http://phaser.io).

This provides a basic setup to get started on a game. Created from messing around with a few tutorials, and browsing through the [Phaser Project Templates](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/master/resources/Project%20Templates).
